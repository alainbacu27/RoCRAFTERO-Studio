Forks on this project/repository is disabled We do not allow RoCRAFTERO Studio to be copied on GitHub, it can still be downloaded from https://minecrftdiversity.jimdofree.com/rocraftero-studio and alternative downloads are https://minecrftdiversity.jimdofree.com/rocraftero-studio-alternative-downloads/

We allow Downloads fron these sites, and hosted in MEGA, MediaFire, Google Drive, etc , play, but no copies, copying this to GitHub doesn't seem right to fork my project on github, because I don't want to.



Sorry, Some people have been forking my project and I don't allow them, you are free to download it to your computer, but not to re-edit it or do anything like cracking it, it's illegal, although the client comes from Roblox Studio from the year 2017, but nothing happens to the program.


Thanks for reading.
